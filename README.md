# BokiProtector

### Version
_**1.0.0**_

### Description

This is a script to hash your password with a random generated salt.
Not the hardest thing to do but still efficient for lazy people to get strong password (especially in 2024).

_**Please be aware that any password generated by this is not recoverable in any way, 
so if you lose the hash given to you, you are cooked, chief.**_

### Guide to run the script (Not the CLI)

To all my fellow non python user, here's quick guide to run this script:

* Open a terminal:
* Go to the directory where you download the script, exemple below
* 
    C:\Users\<User>\Downloads\BokiProtector
```
cd ./Download/BokiProtector
```
* Run the script via 
```
python BokiProtector.py
```

* Then follow the script instruction aka enter the password you want to hash

###### Alternatives

You can run the script by using the BokiProtector.exe or the run_bp.bat.
Both will run the script in the console but only the .exe doesn't require to have python installed on your computer, if I did not fuck up.
